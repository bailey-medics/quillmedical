# Review and update documentation to match the codebase

1. Read all code including Python, Typescript, Storybook stories and components
2. Read all documentation in `/docs/docs/` (exclude `/docs/docs/llm/`, `/docs/docs/code/` and `/docs/docs/safety/`)
3. Compare code vs documentation:
   - Code is the canonical truth
   - Update documentation in `/docs/docs/` to reflect actual implementation
   - If documentation describes features not in the code, leave it as-is (future features)
4. Any issues that you are unsure on how to resolve, ask the user to clarity in a numbered list.
