/**
 * BodyText Component
 *
 * Primary body text component for the application. Renders block-level
 * text at `md` size (19px) with standard body weight (500).
 * Inherits the theme text colour (navy) via `--mantine-color-text`.
 *
 * Line breaks collapse into spaces, as in any paragraph. Set
 * `preserveLines` for text somebody typed into a text area, so the lines
 * they wrote stay the lines that are read. Such text may also hold a
 * word longer than the line, a pasted address above all, so it is allowed
 * to break inside one where it would otherwise run off a phone.
