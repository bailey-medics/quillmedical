/**
 * PageHeader Component
 *
 * Primary page heading (h1) with responsive sizing. Renders larger text
 * on desktop and smaller on mobile, using the sm breakpoint threshold.
 *
 * Carries the page's header action too, when it has one: an "Add" button,
 * a badge. The action sits on the right, and stays on the right when a
 * narrow screen wraps it under the title. A `Group` with
 * `justify="space-between"` did not: a wrapped item is alone on its line,
 * so there is nothing to space it against and it fell to the left.
