/**
 * PageSpinner Component
 *
 * The quill, standing in for a whole page: while the app starts, while it
 * checks who is signed in, while a page's content arrives.
 *
 * It exists so that every such wait puts the quill in exactly the same
 * place at exactly the same size. One wait often passes through several
 * of them in a row, and a quill that moved or changed size between them
 * would jump. For a wait inside a page that is already showing, use
 * `QuillSpinner` itself.
