# Security audit and penetration testing plan

Comprehensive white-hat security audit of Quill Medical — a healthcare SPA with FastAPI backend, React frontend, FHIR/OpenEHR integrations, and Docker infrastructure. The audit covers code review (Phase 1) then automated + manual testing (Phase 2). **One confirmed vulnerability found during discovery** (unsanitised Markdown→HTML in email templates). Overall security posture is strong — Bandit SAST and Dependabot/Renovate dependency scanning are already in CI. Remaining gap: no secret scanning in CI.

## Phase 1: Code review (static analysis)

### 1A. ~~Confirmed vulnerability — unsanitised Markdown in email templates~~ FIXED

- **File**: `backend/app/features/teaching/email_templates.py` (line ~111)
- **Issue**: `markdown.markdown(body_md)` output was used directly without HTML sanitisation
- **Fix applied**: Added `nh3.clean()` around `markdown.markdown()` output; added `nh3` dependency
- **Tests**: Added `test_sanitises_malicious_html_in_body` and `test_preserves_safe_html_after_sanitisation`
- **Severity**: Medium (email clients often strip scripts, but not guaranteed)

### 1B. ~~Authentication and session management review~~ REVIEWED AND FIXED

- **Files**: `backend/app/security.py`, `backend/app/main.py` (auth endpoints), `backend/app/schemas/auth.py`

**Confirmed secure (no action needed):**

- JWT algorithm pinned: `algorithms=[settings.JWT_ALG]` — no `"none"` confusion possible
- JWT secret enforces `min_length=32` via Pydantic field constraint
- Cookie flags correct: HttpOnly, SameSite=lax, Secure=True in production configs
- Login returns generic "Invalid credentials" — no account enumeration via login
- Forgot-password always returns `{"detail": "ok"}` — no account enumeration
- CSRF double-submit cookie validates header + cookie match + signature
- Refresh token scoped to `/api/auth/refresh` path (minimal exposure)
- Argon2id password hashing with OWASP-recommended defaults

**Vulnerabilities found and fixed:**

| # | Severity | Issue | Fix |
|---|----------|-------|-----|
| 1 | Medium | No session invalidation on password change/reset — old refresh tokens valid for 7 days | Added `token_version` column to User model; included `tv` claim in access + refresh JWTs; `current_user` and `refresh` dependencies reject stale tokens; `change_password` and `reset_password` increment `token_version` |
| 2 | Medium | Account enumeration via registration — distinct "Username already exists" / "Email already exists" errors | Changed both messages to generic "Username or email already in use" |
| 3 | Low | Inconsistent password minimum: register=6 chars, change/reset=8 chars | Standardised to 8 characters across all endpoints |
| 4 | Low | TOTP disable didn't require password re-entry — session-hijack could silently disable 2FA | Added `TotpDisableIn` schema requiring `password` field; endpoint now verifies password before disabling |
| 5 | Low | Missing rate limiting on TOTP setup/verify/disable endpoints | Added `@limiter.limit("5/minute")` to all three TOTP endpoints |
| 6 | Info | Auth schemas missing `extra='forbid'` (Pydantic defence-in-depth) | Added `model_config = ConfigDict(extra="forbid")` to all auth schemas |

**Remaining informational items (accepted risk):**

- **No TOTP replay protection**: Same 6-digit code can be reused within the 30-second window. Low risk: requires valid session + code + CSRF, and the window is very short. Server-side used-code tracking would add Redis complexity disproportionate to the risk.
- **Logout doesn't invalidate tokens server-side**: Clears cookies only. With 15-minute access token TTL and token_version on password change, the exposure window is minimal.

### 1C. Authorisation and access control review

- **Files**: `backend/app/main.py`, `backend/app/organisations.py`, `backend/app/messaging.py`, `backend/app/system_permissions/`, `backend/app/cbac/`
- Check: Every endpoint has appropriate auth dependency (DEP_CURRENT_USER, role/permission/CBAC checks)
- Check: IDOR vulnerabilities — can user A access user B's resources by guessing IDs?
- Check: Privilege escalation — can a `staff` user access `admin` endpoints?
- Check: CBAC resolution logic — can additional/removed competencies be manipulated?
- Check: External patient access grants — proper validation of granter authority

### 1D. Input validation and injection review

- **Files**: `backend/app/schemas/` (all), route handlers in `main.py`
- Check: All Pydantic schemas use `extra='forbid'` consistently
- Check: Password complexity requirements
- Check: Email validation (RFC compliance, header injection prevention)
- Check: Message body sanitisation (XSS in stored messages)
- Check: Patient search parameters (injection via FHIR queries)
- Check: Letter content handling (stored XSS via clinical letters)

### 1E. Infrastructure and configuration review

- **Files**: `compose.dev.yml`, `caddy/prod/Caddyfile`, Dockerfiles, `backend/app/config.py`
- Check: Production CSP policy completeness
- Check: Docker container security (non-root confirmed, check for exposed debug ports)
- Check: Secret management (no hardcoded secrets, proper .gitignore)
- Check: CORS production configuration
- Check: Rate limiting thresholds (login, register, API endpoints)

### 1F. Dependency security audit

- **Files**: `backend/pyproject.toml`, `frontend/package.json`
- Already in place: Dependabot vulnerability alerts (weekly scan of pip, npm, Docker, Terraform, GitHub Actions) + Renovate version-bump PRs with 3-tier severity policy and immediate alerts for critical/high CVEs
- No additional `pip-audit` / `yarn audit` needed in CI — Dependabot covers the same CVE databases
- Check: `python-jose` vs `PyJWT` (`python-jose` has had vulnerabilities historically)

### 1G. CI/CD security pipeline gaps

- **Files**: `.github/workflows/`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- Already in place: Bandit SAST runs via pre-commit (`bandit -r backend -x backend/tests`) in the `Python styling` CI job
- Already in place: Dependabot vulnerability alerts + Renovate version-bump PRs for dependency security
- Gap identified: No secret scanning in CI
- Recommendation: Add secret scanning to CI pipeline

## Phase 2: Active testing (penetration testing)

### Tooling

| Tool             | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Install                               |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Schemathesis** | Property-based API fuzzing from OpenAPI spec — auto-generates thousands of test cases covering boundary values, malformed inputs, type confusion, response schema validation, and stateful chained requests | `poetry add --group dev schemathesis` |
| **Hypothesis**   | Property-based testing for individual functions (token parsing, password hashing, input validation) — generates random inputs to find edge cases                                                            | `poetry add --group dev hypothesis`   |
| **pytest**       | Targeted manual security test cases (already installed)                                                                                                                                                     | —                                     |
| **httpx**        | Craft malicious HTTP requests for CSRF bypass, cookie manipulation, header injection (already installed)                                                                                                    | —                                     |

### Rollout plan

1. **Add dev dependencies**: `schemathesis` and `hypothesis` via Poetry
2. **Create test file**: `backend/tests/test_security_pentest.py` with Schemathesis schema tests and Hypothesis property tests
3. **Run locally first**: `docker exec quill_backend sh -lc "pytest tests/test_security_pentest.py -v"` to validate and triage findings
4. **Add monthly CI workflow**: `.github/workflows/security-pentest.yml` — scheduled `cron: '0 3 1 * *'` (1st of each month at 03:00 UTC), runs Schemathesis against the Docker Compose stack, posts results as a GitHub Actions artefact
5. **Triage**: Schemathesis findings that are false positives get added to a `schemathesis.yaml` exclude config; genuine issues become backlog items

### Schemathesis test approach

- **Target**: `http://backend:8000/api/openapi.json` (inside Docker network)
- **Modes**: Schema validation (all endpoints), stateful testing (auth flow → CRUD operations), negative testing (malformed inputs)
- **Auth**: Pre-authenticate with a test user cookie, pass via `--header` or pytest fixture
- **Checks**: `not_a_server_error`, `response_schema_conformance`, `content_type_conformance`, `status_code_conformance`
- **Exclusions**: Rate-limited endpoints may need higher limits or exclusion during fuzzing

### Hypothesis test approach

- Property-based tests for `create_password_reset_token` / `verify_password_reset_token` round-trip
- Property-based tests for `hash_password` / `verify_password` with arbitrary strings
- Property-based tests for `create_csrf_token` / `verify_csrf` round-trip
- Fuzz Pydantic schemas with `hypothesis-jsonschema` to find validation gaps

### 2A. Authentication attacks

- Brute force login with rate limit bypass attempts
- JWT manipulation (alg:none, key confusion, expired token reuse)
- CSRF bypass attempts (missing header, mismatched tokens, cross-origin)
- TOTP replay attacks (reuse same code within window)
- Cookie theft scenarios (check SameSite, Secure flags)

### 2B. Authorisation testing (IDOR / privilege escalation)

- Access other users' conversations by manipulating conversation IDs
- Access other patients' records by manipulating patient IDs
- Escalate from patient → staff → admin via API manipulation
- CBAC bypass: send additional_competencies in profile update without admin
- Org membership: access resources across organisations

### 2C. Injection testing

- SQL injection via ORM bypass (special chars in username, email, search)
- XSS via message body, letter content, patient names
- SSRF via any user-controllable URLs (webhook endpoints, etc.)
- Command injection via any file processing endpoints

### 2D. API abuse testing

- Mass enumeration of user/patient/conversation IDs
- Rate limit exhaustion and bypass
- Large payload attacks (oversized message bodies, excessive participants)
- Concurrent request race conditions (double-spend patterns)

### 2E. Web push subscription abuse

- Flood fake endpoints
- Subscription without authentication verification
- Notification content injection

## Verification

1. Fix 1A → run `just ub`, write test confirming HTML tags are stripped
2. Phase 1 produces a findings document with CVSS-like severity ratings
3. Phase 2 produces pytest tests in `backend/tests/test_security_pentest.py` as regression tests
4. Review Dependabot alerts dashboard for any open vulnerability advisories
5. Review Bandit output from pre-commit: `pre-commit run bandit --all-files`
6. Each finding should be reproducible with a curl command or test case
7. Schemathesis local run produces zero server errors (`5xx`) against all endpoints
8. Monthly CI workflow runs successfully and posts artefact with results

## Decisions

- All testing inside Docker containers per project conventions
- Severity ratings: Critical / High / Medium / Low / Informational
- Focus: OWASP Top 10 + healthcare-specific risks (PHI exposure, clinical data integrity)
- Out of scope: Social engineering, physical security, third-party SaaS (Resend, GCS)

## Further considerations

1. **python-jose vs PyJWT** — `python-jose` has had historical CVEs; consider flagging for future migration to `PyJWT`
2. **TOTP secret encryption at rest** — currently plaintext in DB; could encrypt with application-level key (medium priority, depends on DB encryption posture)
3. **Password reset flow** — now implemented (`/api/auth/forgot-password`, `/api/auth/reset-password`) with time-limited signed tokens; needs to be included in Schemathesis test coverage
