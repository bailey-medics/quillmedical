# Project to-do list

## Branch protection

- [ ] Increase `required_approving_review_count` from 0 to 1 (or higher) in
      `infra/github/branch_rules.tf` when a second developer joins the team.
      Currently set to 0 because a solo developer cannot approve their own PRs.
      The PR requirement still creates an auditable change record for DCB 0129.

## Public site

- [ ] Update the EPR nav link from `https://staging.quill-medical.com` to the
      production URL once `quill-medical-production` is active. The link
      currently points to staging because the production GCP project is
      hibernated for cost savings.

- [ ] Add public pages to the production build and configure the 404 page: 1. Update `frontend/Dockerfile` build stage to also run
      `yarn workspace public-pages build` 2. Merge public pages output into the SPA dist (or serve alongside) 3. Update `caddy/prod/Caddyfile` to serve `.html` pages for clean URLs
      (e.g. `/about` → `about.html`) and use `not-found.html` as the error
      page instead of falling back to the SPA's `index.html` for all routes

## Database naming

- [ ] Rename the auth database to remove "auth" from the name — it is now used
      for more than authentication (organisations, messaging, etc.). This
      affects: 1. Cloud SQL instance name (`quill-auth-{env}` → e.g. `quill-db-{env}`) 2. Database name (`quill_auth` → e.g. `quill`) 3. Terraform variables and module references (`cloud_sql_auth`,
      `auth-db-password`, `AUTH_DB_*` env vars) 4. Backend config (`AUTH_DB_HOST`, `AUTH_DB_NAME`, `AUTH_DB_USER`,
      `AUTH_DB_PASSWORD` in `app/config.py`) 5. Backend DB module (`app/db/auth_db.py`, `AuthSessionLocal`,
      `AuthBase`, `get_auth_db`) 6. All scripts and tests that reference the auth DB 7. Docker Compose service name and environment variables 8. CI/CD workflows and Justfile commands 9. Cloud Run Job admin tooling (env vars set in `build-admin`)

## FHIR/EHRbase VM (COS)

_See [learnings/fhir-ehrbase-issues.md](../learnings/fhir-ehrbase-issues.md) for full context._

- [ ] Redesign `infra/modules/compute-fhir/startup.sh` for COS — Docker
      Compose binary cannot be installed or executed anywhere on
      Container-Optimised OS (read-only root, noexec on writable paths).
      Options: use direct `docker run` commands, run Compose via a container
      image, or switch to a standard VM image.

- [ ] Automate `uuid-ossp` extension creation for the EHRbase Cloud SQL
      database. EHRbase Flyway migrations require `uuid_generate_v4()`, but
      Cloud SQL does not install the extension by default. Currently created
      manually — **must be re-run if the Cloud SQL instance or `ehrbase`
      database is ever destroyed and recreated**. Automate via the VM startup
      script (run `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp"` using a
      disposable postgres container before starting EHRbase).

- [ ] Add missing EHRbase env vars (`DB_USER_ADMIN`, `DB_PASS_ADMIN`) to the
      Terraform compute-fhir module so Flyway can run schema migrations.

- [ ] Rotate temporary postgres admin password (`temp-admin-pw-2026`) on the
      `quill-ehrbase-staging` Cloud SQL instance.

## Real-time auth state refresh

- [ ] Implement automatic auth state refresh when users return to Quill, so
      that nav links and permissions update without a manual page reload.
      **Scenario:** IT adds a doctor to a hospital's organisation — the
      doctor's nav should update when they switch back to Quill, not require
      a full refresh.

      **Options (in order of complexity):**

      1. **Visibility listener** — add a `visibilitychange` listener in
         `AuthContext.tsx` that calls `reload()` when the page becomes visible
         (with a debounce, e.g. max once per 30s). Zero backend changes. Covers
         tab switching, alt-tabbing back from other apps, unminimising, and
         returning from lock screen. Simple and effective for most cases.

      2. **Periodic polling** — add a `setInterval` in `AuthContext` to
         re-fetch `/api/auth/me` every 60s. Wasteful since 99% of polls return
         identical data, but simpler than SSE.

      3. **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** — backend pushes events when org
         membership or features change, frontend subscribes in `AuthContext`.
         True real-time but requires new backend infrastructure, connection
         management, and Caddy config for persistent connections. Worth
         considering if real-time updates are needed elsewhere (e.g. messaging,
         appointments, clinical alerts).

      Option 1 is recommended as a first step; option 3 may be worth investing
      in later as the app grows.

## Dependency management (Renovate / Dependabot)

- [ ] Enable **Dependabot alerts** in repo Settings → Security & analysis
- [ ] Ensure the `info@quill-medical.com` GitHub account **Watches** the repo
      (All activity or Custom → Security alerts)
- [ ] Configure **email routing** in that account's Settings → Notifications →
      Custom routing to route `bailey-medics/quillmedical` notifications to
      `info@quill-medical.com`
- [ ] Create the following repo labels if they don't already exist:
      `dependencies`, `security`, `major-version-bump`, `hotfix`,
      `tier-1-clinical`, `back-merge`

## MISC

- [ ] Update all libraries to most recent
- [ ] Lock value in teaching schema, once locked, same version teaching config.yaml cannot be used, you will need to iterate upwards
- [ ] Redirect `/` to `/teaching` when `CLINICAL_SERVICES_ENABLED` is false —
      currently only the post-login redirect is handled; if an authenticated
      user navigates directly to `/` they see the clinical home page (patient
      list) instead of the teaching dashboard
