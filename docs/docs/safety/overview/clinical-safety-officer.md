# Clinical Safety Officer

## Statutory Requirement

Both DCB 0129 and DCB 0160 require the nomination of a Clinical Safety Officer (CSO). This is a statutory requirement under the Health and Care Act 2012.

## Qualifications

The CSO must:

- Be a **senior clinician** with **current registration** with a professional body (GMC, NMC, GPhC, etc.)
- Have **sufficient training in clinical safety and clinical risk management**
- Be knowledgeable in risk management and its application to clinical domains
- Preserve competency records demonstrating suitability for the role
- Be familiar with the clinical domain of the product

## Training

Training is available through NHS England's Digital Clinical Safety Programme. The portfolio is progressive:

| Course | Format | Cost | Description |
|--------|--------|------|-------------|
| Essentials of Digital Clinical Safety | E-learning | Free for NHS staff | Basic introduction, supports safety culture |
| Clinical Risk Management Programme | E-learning (8 sessions) | Free for NHS staff | Process activities and documents in context of a care scenario |
| Face-to-face course | One day, in person | Varies | Best practice, lessons learnt, networking, recap of DCB 0129/0160 |

Non-NHS staff can purchase e-learning for £35+VAT. Courses are accessed via the e-LfH (e-Learning for Healthcare) platform.

The CSO should undertake refresher training regularly — at least annually is good practice (the Concentric Health example documents annual refresher training).

## Responsibilities

The CSO is responsible for:

- Overseeing the **Clinical Risk Management System** and ensuring it is applied correctly
- Running or overseeing **clinical risk management workshops** (hazard identification sessions)
- **Reviewing and approving** the three key deliverables: CRMP, Hazard Log, CSCR
- Providing **clinical expertise and domain knowledge** to the risk analysis process
- **Raising with Top Management** any hazards evaluated as Unacceptable
- Approving each **deployment to production**, confirming appropriate testing controls are in place
- Reviewing bug and feature tickets for **clinical safety impact** and ensuring ticket priority reflects this
- Coordinating **post-market surveillance** and clinical safety incident management
- Ensuring the Hazard Log and CSCR are reviewed **at least annually**
- Acting as the point of contact for deploying organisations' CSOs during procurement

**Important**: The CSO ensures the work is carried out correctly, but **Top Management retains accountability** for decisions and outputs concerning potential hazards or clinical incidents.

## Quill Medical CSO Arrangement

The Quill Medical CSO is a clinician-developer — a GMC-registered consultant who is also the product's architect and developer. This is a recognised and common arrangement, particularly for early-stage healthtech companies (cf. Concentric Health, where the GMC-registered co-founder/CEO acts as CSO).

### Strengths of this arrangement

- Deep domain knowledge of both the clinical workflows and the technical implementation
- Ability to identify hazards from both clinical and engineering perspectives
- Rapid feedback loop between safety assessment and design decisions

### Managing the inherent tension

There is an inherent tension between the developer role (ship features, meet deadlines) and the CSO role (objectively assess risk, potentially block releases). To manage this:

- Hazard identification workshops must always be **multidisciplinary** — even the CSO acting alone is insufficient. Involve other clinicians, end-users, and technical contributors.
- Document safety decisions transparently, including any trade-offs.
- As the product scales, plan to bring in an **external, independent CSO** to add objectivity and credibility. This can be via consultancy retainer (typical cost £5,000–£15,000/year depending on complexity and release frequency).
- Deploying organisations' CSOs will scrutinise the arrangement — be prepared to explain the governance structure and how independence is maintained.
