# Hazard

---

## Hazard name

Authentication state race condition on app mount

---

## General utility label

[2]

---

## Likelihood scoring

TBC

---

## Severity scoring

TBC

---

## Description

AuthContext useEffect calls reload() on mount without cleanup or cancellation, causing race condition where multiple rapid mounts (React StrictMode, navigation events) trigger duplicate authentication fetches with potential setState after unmount.

---

## Causes

1. useEffect calls reload() on mount without cancellation token
2. No cleanup function to cancel in-flight requests
3. React StrictMode double-mounts in dev causing duplicate fetches
4. setState called multiple times with different authentication state

---

## Effect

User authentication state becomes inconsistent. User may appear logged in but actually unauthenticated, or vice versa.

---

## Hazard

User believes they are authenticated and proceeds to view patient data, but requests fail mid-workflow with 401 errors causing lost work and confusion.

---

## Hazard type

- UnauthorizedAccess
- DataLoss

---

## Harm

Clinical workflow interrupted causing unsaved clinical documentation to be lost. Critical details forgotten during re-entry of documentation leading to incomplete clinical records and potential patient harm.

## Hazard controls

### Design controls (manufacturer)

- Add AbortController to reload() function: create AbortController, pass signal to axios config, abort in useEffect cleanup. Prevents setState after unmount.
- Use React Query for authentication state management: replaces custom reload logic with built-in request cancellation, caching, and stale-while-revalidate behavior.
- Add authentication state machine: define explicit states (LOADING, AUTHENTICATED, UNAUTHENTICATED, ERROR). Prevent invalid state transitions. Use xstate library for formal state machine.
- Implement request de-duplication: track in-flight auth requests using useRef, skip new fetch if request already in-flight. Return existing promise to multiple callers.
- Disable React StrictMode in production build (already disabled by default). In development, handle double-mount gracefully by ignoring second mount's fetch if first still active.

### Testing controls (manufacturer)

- Unit test: Mount AuthContext, immediately unmount before fetch completes. Assert no setState warnings in console about updating unmounted component. Verify AbortController.abort() called in cleanup.
- Integration test: Mount AuthContext, verify reload() called once. Unmount and remount 3 times rapidly. Assert only 1 in-flight request at any time, previous requests aborted.
- Unit test: Mock auth API to return authenticated state, then immediately return unauthenticated state (race condition). Verify state machine prevents invalid state transition or reconciles correctly.
- React StrictMode test: Enable StrictMode in test environment, mount AuthContext, verify no duplicate fetches or state inconsistencies despite double-mount behavior.

### Training controls (deployment)

- Document for developers: Always use cleanup functions in useEffect for async operations. Add AbortController pattern to coding standards.
- Train on React best practices: setState after unmount indicates missing cleanup. Use linting rules to detect potential issues.

### Business process controls (deployment)

- Code review: All useEffect hooks with async operations must include cleanup function canceling in-flight requests.
- CI/CD: Run tests with React StrictMode enabled to catch mount/unmount race conditions before production.
