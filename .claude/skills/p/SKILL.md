# Create a plan document

Using the decisions and information we have just gathered, create a new
`docs/docs/plans/` plan document, using the plan docs rules you have.

Those rules are in `.claude/rules/plans.md`. Read it before writing: it
only loads on its own once a plan file is being touched.

The plan is written to be built by `/f`, so follow "Write it to be built
by `/f`" in those rules closely: one phase per reviewable unit, a first
phase safe to be live on its own, and an `## Open questions` checklist
for anything the conversation left undecided. If there is one, list
those questions in the reply as well; `/g` settles them before `/f`
runs.
