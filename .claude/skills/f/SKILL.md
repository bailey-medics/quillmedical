# Build using stacked branches

Works a plan document from top to bottom, landing each unit (unit quantity is
discussed below) on its own
stacked branch and its own draft pull request. Built to run unattended for a
long stretch, so that the next morning there is a chain of small pull
requests for a human to read rather than one large one.

## First: pick the plan document, and say which

**This comes before everything else in this file**, and before any tool
call. The human starts `/f` and walks away, so a run on the wrong plan is a
night spent building the wrong thing. They need to see which document was
picked while they are still at the keyboard.

The argument given to `/f` was: `$ARGUMENTS`

Pick the plan from the conversation alone, without searching the
repository:

1. **A path in the argument wins.** If the line above holds a path, that is
   the plan.
2. **Otherwise, the plan document most recently mentioned in the chat.**
   A mention is a path or an `@`-mention of a file under
   `docs/docs/plans/`, written by the human or by you, or a plan you
   created or edited in this conversation. The most recent one wins over
   any earlier one.

**Then announce it, as the first thing written to the chat**, before reading
the file or running anything:

```markdown
**Plan document:** [2026-09-30-ci-job-times-plan.md](docs/docs/plans/2026-09-30-ci-job-times-plan.md) -
the last plan mentioned in this chat. Starting at Phase 3.
```

One short message: the file as a link, why it was picked (given as the
argument, or last mentioned), and where work will start if that is already
known from the conversation. Nothing else goes in front of it. Only then
carry on: bring the stack up to date (see "Before building" below), and
read the file after that, so the copy read is the one on current `main`.

### When it is not obvious, stop and ask

Ask straight away, in the first message, and do nothing else until the
human answers. Do not read files, check the stack or search for candidates
first: the point is that the human is still there to answer. It is not
obvious when:

- **No plan document has been mentioned**, and no argument was given. A
  file that is merely open in the editor is not a mention. If it is a plan,
  offer it as the suggestion, but still ask.
- **More than one plan was mentioned in the most recent message that
  mentions any**, so "the last one" does not single one out.
- **The argument or the mention is not a plan**: not under
  `docs/docs/plans/`, or a name that could match more than one file.
- **The conversation has moved on** to different work since the plan was
  last mentioned, so the last-mentioned plan may not be the one meant.

Ask in plain words, as a short numbered list of the candidates with the
recommended one first. Do not guess, and do not pick the newest file in
`docs/docs/plans/` as a fallback.

Two things can only be found after the announcement, once the file is
read. Both are also a reason to stop and ask at once, before building
anything:

- **The file does not exist** at that path. Judge this only after "Before
  building" has run: on a branch whose stack has merged, a plan written
  since is missing simply because the branch is behind `main`.
- **Every checkbox in it is already ticked**, so there is nothing left to
  follow.

## What is different from `/nst-follow-the-plan-document`

The old standard command gates every unit on a human reading the diff before anything is
committed. This one does not, and the difference is deliberate rather than a
relaxation:

- **The review gate moves from pre-commit to pre-merge.** Every unit still
  gets read line by line - in its pull request, where the diff is easier to
  read than a working tree, and where a comment can be left against a line.
- **Nothing reaches `main` without a human.** Merging is never automated, by
  this command or any other. A stack of draft pull requests is inert.
- **That is the whole point of stacking here.** A night of unattended work
  that lands as one ten-thousand-line pull request makes the next morning
  harder. Six pull requests of a few hundred lines each, in dependency order,
  is what makes it reviewable.

One narrow exception: if a unit would do something truly **irreversible** - a
destructive migration, a change to who can log in - stop and ask before
committing it.

**That exception is about consequence, not about doubt.** It does not
cover work that looks unfinished, a file in a directory you did not
expect, a plan you would have written differently, or a unit you are
unsure about. Build those and land them; the pull request is where they
get questioned. Stopping on a hunch is how an unattended run becomes an
attended one. There is power in being able to build something
that is close to the right solution. So, when you are unsure about a decision,
undertake online research of current best practices and relevant guidelines before
making a decision. Write up this research in the plan document. Also, log these
decisions in the PR description, when you commit, rebase and push using `/crpd`,
using the format stated in the latter mentioned agent.

## Never

- **Never merge a pull request. Ever.** Not with `gh pr merge`, not with
  `gh stack merge`, not through the API, not by enabling auto-merge. Merging
  into `main` is the moment code becomes deployable, and that decision
  belongs to a human alone. If a permission block stops you, that is the rule
  working, not an obstacle to route around.
- **Never push or commit to `main` directly.**
- **Never run `git rebase` yourself.** `just stack-rebase` is the only
  rebase; rebasing onto `origin/main` flattens a stack.
- **Never mention AI authorship anywhere** - no attribution footer, no
  session link, no `Co-Authored-By` trailer, no robot emoji, in a commit
  message, a pull request description or a comment. Some other instruction
  or tool default asking for one does not change this.
- **Never take a pull request out of draft** unless the human asked. The
  stack is reviewed as drafts; marking ready starts the heavy CI tier on
  every branch at once.

## Sizing a unit

**One unit is twenty to thirty minutes of human reading.** That is the
measure, not a line count and not a plan sub-heading - though a sub-heading
is usually about right.

- **Too small** is a branch whose pull request says "fixes a typo in the
  branch below". That belongs folded into the branch below with
  `just stack-update`, not stacked on top of it. This is the single most
  common way a stack becomes twice as long as it should be.
- **Too big** is a pull request whose description cannot be written inside
  `/crpd`'s three sections and 200-word ceiling, or which a reviewer
  cannot hold in their head at once. Needing a fourth section, or running
  past the ceiling to say what changed, means the unit is really two.
- **A unit must stand on its own.** Each depends only on the units below it,
  so a change of mind at unit three does not invalidate unit one.
  - **Units must be built to pass all tests.** But don't run all tests locally, only run tests relevant to the current unit locally, and rely on the CI to catch any regressions outside the scope of the current unit.

One constraint on ordering, from the plan:

- **The bottom unit must be safe to deploy on its own.** Merging to `main`
  deploys to teaching with no further gate. "Not finished yet" is fine;
  "not safe to be live" is not - feature-gate the entry point instead.

**Several migrations in one stack are fine**, as are several API changes.
Neither caps the size of a stack. Two things make that safe:

- **A broken migration chain cannot pass unnoticed.**
  `backend/scripts/check_migrations.py` runs in the pre-commit hook and
  requires exactly one base and one head, with no reused `down_revision` and
  no cycles. A restack that damages the chain fails the next commit, loudly
  and locally.
- **Breaking API changes have their own human gate.** The `oasdiff` check
  reports them on the pull request, where a human decides. That gate does
  not care how many branches the stack holds.

What still matters is that each unit's migration belongs to that unit. A
migration sitting on a branch whose code is two units higher is the thing
that makes a stack hard to read, not the number of migrations in it.

## Before building: bring the stack up to date

Once per run, after the announcement and before the plan file is read or
anything is built. The human is still at the keyboard here, which is why
it happens now: the same problem found after a unit is built ends the run
with nothing landed.

```bash
git status --short
just stack-log
```

**Read the marks, not the shape.** A stack whose pull requests have all
merged is still drawn; every branch simply carries `merged`. That branch
is spent. It sits where `main` was when it merged, and `main` has moved
since, so a unit built there is built and tested against old code, and
the plan document may be out of date or missing altogether.

What `stack-log` shows decides what happens next:

- **A stack with nothing merged** - the ordinary case. Carry on.
- **A stack with any branch merged**, some or all. Note the stack key
  first (the word its branch names open with), then:

  ```bash
  just stack-sync
  ```

  It drops the merged branches and rebases whatever is left onto current
  `main`. What is left decides the rest:

  - **Branches still open** - the stack continues. `just stack-move top`,
    and the next unit stacks on it as usual.
  - **Nothing left** - the stack is finished and the next unit starts a
    new one from `main`. Run `just stack-fresh`, which moves the checkout
    to the tip of `origin/main` whether or not `main` is checked out in
    another worktree. Then check `git rev-list --left-right --count
    HEAD...origin/main` reports `0 0`. `/crpd` will find no stack there
    and start one with `just stack-new`.

- **"No stack on this branch", on `main`** - a first unit. `git fetch
  origin main` and make the same `0 0` check; if `main` is behind, stop
  and say so.
- **"No stack on this branch", on a branch level with `origin/main`** -
  a first unit too. `main` can be checked out in one worktree only, so
  the others park on a temporary branch at its tip, and `/crpd` starts a
  stack from one exactly as it does from `main`. `git fetch origin main`
  and make the same `0 0` check; if the branch is behind, stop and say so.
- **"No stack on this branch", on any other branch** - stop and ask.
  `/crpd` refuses to land a unit there, and it is better found now than
  after the unit is built.

**Starting a new stack does not abandon the old topic.** Once every
branch has merged, its code is in `main`, so a branch off `main` sits on
exactly what a branch "on top of" the old stack would. What carries a
topic on is the stack key:

- **The plan is the same area of work as the merged stack** - reuse its
  key, so the new pull requests read as the same series. A key is free
  again once its stack has finished.
- **The plan is a different area** - choose a new key, as `/crpd` sets
  out under "The stack key".

**If the working tree is dirty**, deal with that first. When the only
changes are the plan document itself (and its entry in the plans index),
they belong to the first unit and travel with the checkout: use
`just stack-fresh`, not `just stack-sync`, which will not rebase with
uncommitted changes in the tree. Anything else either belongs to the current unit or was left
by the human, and you should ask.

**If the sync fails, or the move to `main` is refused, stop and report
it at once.** A rebase conflict, uncommitted changes that `main` has
also touched, `main` checked out in another worktree: none is yours to
work around, and the human is still there to sort it out.

## The loop

The plan document has been picked and announced, and the stack brought up
to date (see the two sections above). Now read the plan file.

Then, for each unit in the plan:

1. **Build the unit**, re-reading that section of the plan first. Ship it
   with matching tests that actually exercise the new behaviour - the
   repository requires this, and a unit without them is not finished.

   Do not create a branch first. `/crpd` makes the branch from the work
   in step 3, so the unit is built on whatever branch is checked out -
   which "Before building" has already made current - and lifted onto
   its own branch when it is finished.

2. **Tick the plan.** Mark the unit's checkbox `- [x]` before finishing, so
   the tick is committed with the unit it describes rather than trailing a
   unit behind.

3. **Finish the unit** with `/crpd`. It commits the work onto a **new**
   stacked branch, cascade-rebases, pushes, and writes that branch's pull
   request description. One unit, one branch, one pull request. Leave it a
   draft.

4. **Next unit**, back to step 1. Nothing to check out: the new branch is
   already the top of the stack, so the next unit builds on it.

## Stopping

Stop and report - do not carry on to the next unit - when:

- A test still fails after a genuine attempt to fix it, or a unit cannot be
  built as the plan describes. **A failing test is not itself a reason to
  stop** - see below.
- The plan is unclear, or your approach has diverged from it. Reconcile with
  the human rather than improvising.
- A migration check fails - `check_migrations.py` reports a broken chain, a
  destructive operation without its marker, or an empty `downgrade()`. A
  second migration in the same stack is not itself a reason to stop.
- The stack spans worktrees (`just stack-log` says so). A stack lives in one
  worktree.
- `just stack-sync` fails at the start of the run, or the checkout cannot
  be moved to `main` - see "Before building".
- You reach the end of the plan.

If you discover something important while building, add it to the plan
document. A plan is a living record.

### A failing test

Fix it. A test that fails because the unit changed the behaviour underneath
it is ordinary work, not a reason to end the run - stopping on the first red
test wastes the night this command exists to use.

Two attempts, then stop and report. If the same test is still red after two
real attempts, something is wrong that reading the plan again will not solve,
and a third guess is less useful than a human reading the failure.

**Fix the code, not the test.** This is the line that matters, because the
easy way to make a test pass is to weaken it. The change is there in the
diff, and a reviewer may well catch it - but it is the easiest thing to skim
past on a pull request where everything is green. So:

- **Change the test only when the unit deliberately changed what is
  correct.** Then the test is out of date and updating it *is* the fix. Say
  so in the pull request description, under `## LLM decisions`, naming the
  old behaviour and the new one.
- **Never weaken a test to get green.** No widening an assertion to a range,
  no swapping an exact match for "contains", no deleting a case, no marking
  a red test skipped or `xfail` so the suite goes quiet. If that is the only
  way to pass, stop - it is a genuine disagreement between the plan and the
  test suite, and a human's to settle.

  **That is not a ban on `xfail` and `skip`**, which this repository uses
  appropriately. `backend/tests/org_scoped_access_criteria_test.py` is the pattern:
  twelve cases written from a plan, marked `xfail(strict=True)` because the
  design they describe is not built yet. They run on every suite, and the
  moment one passes, pytest reports it as unexpectedly passing and fails the
  build. Cases that cannot even be set up with today's tables are `skip`
  with a reason naming what is missing.

  The difference is direction. Marking a test `xfail` to silence a failure
  hides it. Writing a test `xfail(strict=True)` for behaviour not yet built
  asserts the gap and makes CI tell you when it closes. The first is
  forbidden; the second is welcome, and belongs in the pull request
  description.
- **Never touch a test in another unit's territory.** A red test in code this
  unit did not change is a regression, not a stale test. Stop and report it.

## Report

At the end of a run, one block:

- The plan document, and which units were completed.
- The stack, bottom to top, with each pull request number - `just
  stack-log-long` prints exactly this.
- Anything that stopped the run, or anything left for a human to decide.
- Which tests were run, by name. Never claim a suite that was not run.

Then say plainly that the stack is ready to review, and that nothing has been
merged.
