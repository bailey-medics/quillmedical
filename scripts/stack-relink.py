"""Put a stack's open pull requests into a stack on GitHub by linking.

`just stack-refresh` rebuilds the local record with `gh stack unstack`
and then adopts the branches again. That unstack is also asked of
GitHub, which refuses once any pull request in the stack has merged ("Pull
requests #1356, #1358 cannot be removed from this stack"). On
2026-10-02 that left the open pull requests in no stack on GitHub at
all, and they were put back by hand. This script is that repair.

It leaves the old stack on GitHub alone. The recipe rebuilds the local
record without touching GitHub (`gh stack unstack --local`, then
`gh stack init`), and then calls this to:

- find the open pull request for each branch, by asking GitHub rather
  than trusting the number in the record, which is wrong for a pull
  request that was closed and replaced;
- `gh stack link` them, bottom to top. That makes a new stack when
  they are in none, and changes nothing when they are still in one;
- write that stack's `id` and `number` into the local record, so
  gh-stack treats the two as the same stack.

Pull requests are linked by number, never by branch name: given a
branch, `gh stack link` pushes it first, and a refresh must not push.

It also checks, and repairs, GitHub's stack for a stack that has only
drifted. `gh stack submit` only ever adds to GitHub's stack, and reports
a pull request it could not add as a warning, exiting 0. On 2026-10-16
a 24-branch stack was found split in two on GitHub, with eight pull
requests in neither: a closed pull request left at the top of GitHub's
stack refused every addition after it, since each must be based on the
one below. Nothing said so until the stack was opened in a browser.

Four modes:

    stack-relink.py --needed              exit 0 when GitHub's stack for
                                          the current branch holds a
                                          merged pull request, 1 when it
                                          does not
    stack-relink.py --link <branch>...    link and repoint, as above
    stack-relink.py --check <branch>...   exit 0 when the open pull
                                          requests are one stack on
                                          GitHub, in this order, with no
                                          closed one in it; 1 when not,
                                          saying what is wrong
    stack-relink.py --repair <branch>...  add any missing from the top
                                          of the stack holding the rest;
                                          failing that, unstack every
                                          stack on GitHub holding them,
                                          keeping the local record, then
                                          link and repoint

Exit codes for `--link` and `--repair`: 0 linked and recorded, 1 it
could not be done.
