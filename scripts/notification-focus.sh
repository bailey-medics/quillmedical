# Bring the editor window for one worktree to the front.
#
# Run when a Stop-hook banner is clicked, with the worktree path as $1. The
# windows are usually spread across Spaces, so this is what turns "something
# finished" into "take me there".
#
# For a worktree on the dev box, $2 is the name VS Code knows the box by
# over Remote-SSH, such as "devbox", and $1 is the path on the box. Its
# window is titled "<file> - quillmedical-5 [SSH: devbox]", and the folder
# is opened by its vscode-remote address instead of by `open -a`, since the
# path does not exist on the Mac.
#
# Two ways, fastest first:
#
#   1. AXRaise through System Events, about 330ms. VS Code titles a window
#      "<file> - <folder>", so a title ending in the folder's basename finds
#      it. Needs Accessibility permission, and System Events lists only the
#      windows on the Space in view, so this finds nothing for a worktree on
#      another Space.
#
#   2. `open -a`, which asks macOS to hand the folder to the editor. The
#      editor brings forward the window already holding it, and macOS
#      follows to that window's Space, in either direction. With no such
#      window it opens the folder in a new one.
#
# The title must end with the folder name, not merely contain it. The main
# checkout is "quillmedical", which every "quillmedical-3" contains: a click
# on its banner raised whichever worktree was already in view and stopped
# there, so the Space never changed.
#
# `open -a` rather than `code -r`. `-r` reuses the window in front when no
# window holds the path, replacing the worktree open in it.
#
# The second only runs for a path that is a real directory, so a stale or
# mistyped path opens nothing.
#
# Failure is silent: a click that does nothing is a poor outcome, but an
# error dialog over whatever the user is doing is worse.
