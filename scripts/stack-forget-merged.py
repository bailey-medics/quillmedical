"""Drop merged branches from the local gh-stack record.

`gh stack sync --prune` deletes the *local branch* of a merged pull
request, which is the half that frees the name. It does not remove the
branch's entry from the stack, so a stack that has been landing units for
a few days draws more merged rows than live ones, and every one of them
has nothing left behind it - the branch is already gone.

Worse, those entries are not only noise. `gh stack rebase` walks the chain
from the bottom, and an entry whose branch cannot be checked out costs it
the base it should be rebasing onto: it falls back to replaying the
trunk's own history, which arrives as a long run of conflicts against
commits that merged days ago. That is the failure this script exists to
prevent, seen on 2026-09-18 replaying 58 commits.

An entry is finished, and dropped, in either of two cases.

**Its local branch is gone.** Whatever its pull request is recorded as,
an entry with no branch behind it is the broken chain above.

**Its branch is still there, but its tip is already in the trunk**, and
gh-stack is not going to tidy it up itself. That second half matters:
`gh stack sync --prune` deletes the branch of a pull request it sees
merge, and an entry dropped before it gets there leaves that branch
behind. So a branch whose tip is in the trunk is dropped only when:

- the record already says its pull request merged, so gh-stack has seen
  the merge and left the branch; or
- GitHub says the recorded pull request is closed without merging; or
- no pull request is recorded at all.

The closed case is the one this rule exists for. A pull request that is
closed and replaced by another on the same branch (#1363 by #1386, on
2026-10-02) leaves the record pointing at the closed one. When the
replacement merges, gh-stack never learns of it, keeps the entry as
live, and pushes a branch GitHub has deleted. The tip being in the
trunk is the evidence the recorded number cannot give.

Three entries are always left alone, whatever the trunk holds:

- the branch checked out here, which is somebody's working copy;
- a branch with no commits of its own, whose tip is its own base: it is
  in the trunk only because nothing has been put on it yet;
- one whose recorded pull request GitHub cannot be asked about. Not
  knowing is not evidence, so it stays.

Exit codes: 0 wrote a change or found nothing to do, 1 the record could
not be read.
