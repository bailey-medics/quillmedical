# Show the Linux dev box's banners on the Mac, by fetching them.
#
# The box has no screen, so notification.sh there only offers each banner,
# as a JSON line in a queue file. This runs on the Mac, under the launchd
# agent `just notify-listen-install` sets up: it holds one SSH connection to
# the box, follows the queue with `tail -F`, and shows each banner with the
# Mac's own notification-show.sh. So the box never connects to the Mac, and
# what it sends is text, which notification-queue.py checks, never code.
#
# Nothing polls: a banner arrives as soon as it is written. When the
# connection drops, after sleep or a change of network, it tries again
# every QUILL_NOTIFY_RETRY seconds. tail starts each connection with the
# last few lines, so a banner written while the Mac was away still shows if
# it is recent; the queue helper skips anything already shown or too old.
#
# QUILL_NOTIFY_BOX is the box as the Mac's ssh knows it, and as VS Code
# titles its windows: "devbox" unless set.
#
# The Mac's bash is 3.2, so nothing newer than that is used here.
